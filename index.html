      <h1>How was our sailing?</h1>
      <p>Home grown in right here in Swansea, Veeqo is on a global mission to change the way retail brands run their ecommerce operations. In a fast paced, high growth environment it can be hard to come up for air and enjoy our beautiful home city, whilst also helping charitable organisations who are in their own way changing the world we live in.</p>
      <p>To that end, we were keen to float our way to fame and fortune by taking the trophy of fastest raft at the Mumbles Raft Race - with our newly produced raft: The Omniraft.</p>
      <p>We hope you can join us at this event to raise money for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, a great organization that provides support at sea throughout the UK.</p>
